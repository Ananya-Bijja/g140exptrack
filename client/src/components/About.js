        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>
          Our system captures images of children while they play educational games designed for dyslexic learners. Using cutting-edge computer vision algorithms, we analyze their facial expressions in real-time to understand their emotional responses. This data is then used to adapt and improve the game elements, ensuring a positive and effective learning experience tailored to each childâ€™s needs.
